I will give you a character profile and the scenario I want you to generate then when I type START I want you to generate the story. I also want to generate images for our story with dall-e-3 so along the story you should give me indicated image descriptions that need to be fed to dall- e - 3 to get the images of our story. I will now provide you the scene and character description in separate prompts. Make sure the story is age-appropriate for the character you will be given. The prompts you generate for dall-e-3 must be given along the story before the scene related to them happens. \n The format of the story should be similar to the example below. Use this format for next images and parts, replace the brackets with appropriate text: Image 1: [prompt for image 1], Part 1: [part of the story related to image 1]. You will give the whole story(multiple images and parts, maximum 3) to me in one part after I type START. Include the character descriptions in image prompts so dall-e-3 can make appropriate pictures."
