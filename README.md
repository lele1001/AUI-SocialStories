## Project Description

The *Social Stories* web application is designed to create an innovative platform for individuals with high-functioning Neuro-Developmental Disorders (NDD), with a particular focus on adolescents and young adults. By leveraging advanced technologies such as ChatGPT and DALL·E APIs, the project aims to generate personalized social narratives that merge therapeutic insights with cutting-edge artificial intelligence.

This application facilitates the creation of dynamic, age-appropriate social stories tailored to various scenarios, helping users understand and navigate social situations. Emphasizing engagement and simplicity, the platform incorporates user-friendly interfaces developed in ReactJS for the frontend and Python for the backend, ensuring smooth interactions and accessibility. Extensive research into social stories, conversational AI, and generative image technologies revealed limitations in existing approaches, motivating the development of a more adaptive, diverse, and immersive storytelling experience. Future versions of the application will integrate advanced text-to-speech features, enhanced visual dynamics, and interactive scenario-based modules to further enhance user experience.

The *Social Stories* web application seeks to bridge therapeutic methodologies with technological advancements, offering a promising tool to improve social skills, foster independence, and support individuals in navigating the complexities of social interaction within the NDD community.
